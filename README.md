# NFL_analysis
A repository containing notebooks that I will be using as I learn about nfl analytics. I will additionally be using this as a way to further develop my visiualization skills using seaborn, bokeh, and plotly.

This will develop further as I go. But as of now I will be mainly focusing on WR research.
